# Lord of the Rings -- React Application

## Description
I thought it would be a good learning experience to code my favorite movie series in React. In this application I used a 3rd-party api called The-One-Api which is a free api that I leveraged to get the Characters, Movies, and books for all of the Lord of the Rings movies.
In this application you can type in whatever character you want to search for in and it will populate with their name and information abut the character.

## Motivation
What motivated me to make this application was make something with a 3rd-party api for practice and I thought what better way to do that then my favorite movie series!
